# UPM PRO by unique_coder exploit [2.0.5]
Exploit for the Ultimate Project Manager by unique_coder [&lt;= 2.0.5].

During one of my security audits, I found a SQLi vulnerability. There is a 'search' parameter on */frontend/get_article_suggestion/* which is vulnerable to SQLi payloads.

However, UNION queries are not permitted. So I created a fuzzer which can retrieve usernames and hashes from the database through an 'almost blind' approach.

This PoC will retrieve the first username on the database and its SHA-512 hash (128 hex characters).

[This video shows the vulnerability using BurpSuite and how the exploit works.](https://youtu.be/CVbr07d0TTo)
